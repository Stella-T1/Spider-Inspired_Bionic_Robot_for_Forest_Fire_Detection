## 🌲 Project Abstract

This project presents a bionic robot prototype inspired by the locomotion of spiders, specifically designed for real-time forest fire detection in unstructured environments. By integrating multi-sensor modules, obstacle-adaptive limb mechanisms, and early-warning logic, the system offers a mobile, scalable, and biologically inspired solution for environmental monitoring. The project addresses both robotic design and environmental sensing challenges, contributing to the development of autonomous forest surveillance technologies.

## 🧠 Motivation and Research Problem

Forest fires are increasingly frequent and destructive due to climate change and human activity. Early detection is crucial for mitigating their environmental and economic impacts. However, traditional methods such as satellite imaging or fixed-location sensors often suffer from low resolution, delayed response times, and lack of ground-level detail in dense vegetation.

Inspired by the robust adaptability of spider locomotion, this project proposes a mobile robotic solution capable of traversing uneven terrains and detecting fire-related indicators (e.g., temperature, gas concentration, flame presence). The interdisciplinary system explores the convergence of **biomechanics**, **sensor fusion**, and **autonomous exploration**.
